My final year project at university was the electronics and software for a digital photo frame. To keep the unit costs low, the project uses a cheap AVR32 microcontroller, and a custom-designed video output board.

After a very theoretical course, I enjoyed applying my technical skills to create a product. It was fun to take a project from pouring over data sheets through PCB design to the software development and user interface design.

The final device would show images from an inserted SD card or from an online gallery, and included a web interface and Javascript bookmarklet to start a slideshow from Facebook or Flickr.
