The BT Sport Traffic database is a workflow tool used by the post-production team at the UK channel BT Sport.

The system tracks all non-live content that is aired on BT Sport and their network of channels. After importing the upcoming programme information from their scheduling system, the team has a dashboard showing all upcoming programmes and their progress to broadcast, so they can ensure that programmes have been edited, QCâ€™d and are ready to broadcast in their scheduled slot.

The project was built as a Django app, backed by PostgreSQL, and deployed to Heroku.
