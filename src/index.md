  <h2>Hi! I'm Joe.</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a nerd in my 30s living and working in London. I make things with technology. I'm obsessed with the interface—how code talks, how systems work together, but most importantly, the interface between technology and people: the user interface.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I design and make things at <a href="https://nordprojects.co">Nord Projects</a> with my friends Ben Pawle and Mike Colville.</li>
    <li>I write open source code like <a href="https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel">cibuildwheel</a> and <a href="https://github.com/joerick/pyinstrument">pyinstrument</a>.</li>
    <li>I play music every now and again.</li>
  </ul>
