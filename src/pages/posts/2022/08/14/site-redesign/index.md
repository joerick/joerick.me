# I made a new website!

_August 2022_

> It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a developer in possession of a
good domain, must be in want of a website.

A homage to user experiences gone by.

Classic Mac OS has a special place in my heart. As well as the place that I
would go as a boy to play my games, it was where computers really began to
open up to me. There was something about the Mac as a window into another
world that I can still feel the excitement of.

The Mac had this intentionality about it, which I could sense then, which made
me want to dig in and know more. I wanted to know how it was made. I wondered
who it was made by.

Many people have recognised the idea that computers are a place for children
to have control. For me, having a place where I could arrange the icons and
fiddle with the settings was amazing. When you're a kid, you don't get to
change much about your world - the adults are in charge. But here, things are
different.
